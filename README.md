ðŸ’¬ I am 12 years old. and my name is Milan. I'm from Ukraine. I love the Minecraft game. In it you can show your creativity. You can build great buildings, create something new. I also play dota2!
ðŸ”­ Currently I am an experienced Minecraft server developer. Not so long ago I became a hosting and server creation assistant for minecraft - CanvasGrief. I am planning to create my own Minecraft server with the Russian community.
ðŸŒ± I studied languages â€‹â€‹such as: Java, Python, C ++
I also plan to use them in creating my plugins
